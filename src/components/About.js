            <p className= "about-body">Since i was young i have always been fascinated by the thought of
                creating from the comfort of the computer, it always seemed like
                the only path i would ever really consider for myself, and it was
                no surprise to me when i indeed developed a passion for web
                development while learning about it, the process of running into
                a challenge and taking different steps to solve it interests me 
                a lot and then the joy of seeing a working site and the feeling
                of growth when you're done only brings satisfaction and it has 
                only gotten better as i dive deeper into it.
                I personally believe in continuing to acquire information and
                knowledge from wherever i can from whichever field interests me
                as i believe knowledge and information are some of the most
                important things to have when navigating through life,
                This is personally my 5th time of learning web development
                but this is the deepest i have gone in all my attempts,
                and i attribute that to the fact that it was something i
                personally decided i would do hence i had enough drive to
                stick with it even when it presented challenges. I am a newly
                graduated Computer science student and am now on my way to becoming
                a fully fledged web developer.
                Since I finished school, I have devoted as much time as I can to
                improve my web development skills and also my communication and
                interpersonal skills as I believe these are important skills to have
                in any workplace and you can never have too much of it in any environment.
                Learning to code has also had positive effects in my personal life as it taught me to be 
                accountable to myself and have better discipline with my time as I know I
                have to put in hours everyday into learning web development no matter how
                I may personally feel. And I am constantly working to better myself everyday
                as i believe if you're not developing yourself whenever you can, then you
                would be gradually left behind.  Some of the projects I've worked on can
                be found on the projects page.
