            <p className= "about-body">Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by the thought
            of creating from the comfort of the computer. It always seemed like the only path I would
            ever really consider for myself. It was no surprise to me when I indeed developed a passion
            for web development while learning about it. The process of running into a challenge and
            taking different steps to solve it interests me a lot. Then, the joy of seeing a working
            site and the feeling of growth when you're done only brings satisfaction. It has only
            gotten better as I dive deeper into it.<br/><br/>

            I personally believe in continuing to acquire information and knowledge from wherever I can,
            from whichever field interests me, as I believe knowledge and information are some of the most
            important things to have when navigating through life.<br/><br/>

            This is personally my 5th time of learning web development, but this is the deepest I have gone
            in all my attempts. I attribute that to the fact that it was something I personally decided I
            would do, hence I had enough drive to stick with it even when it presented challenges.
            I am a newly graduated Computer Science student and am now on my way to becoming a fully-fledged
            web developer.<br/><br/>

            Since I finished school, I have devoted as much time as I can to improve my web development skills
            and also my communication and interpersonal skills. I believe these are important skills to have in
            any workplace, and you can never have too much of it in any environment.<br/><br/>

            Learning to code has also had positive effects on my personal life as it taught me to be accountable
            to myself and have better discipline with my time. I know I have to put in hours every day into
            learning web development no matter how I may personally feel. I am constantly working to better
            myself every day. I believe if you're not developing yourself whenever you can, then you would
            be gradually left behind.<br/><br/>
