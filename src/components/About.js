            <p className= "about-body">Since I was young, I have always been fascinated by the thought of solving complex problems from the comfort of a computer.
            It always felt like the only path I would truly consider for myself. So, it was no surprise when I developed a deep passion for cybersecurity while learning about it. 
            The process of encountering security challenges and taking different steps to address them fascinates me. The satisfaction of securing a system and the feeling of growth
            after solving a tough problem is something that has only gotten stronger as I dive deeper into this field.<br/><br/>

            I personally believe in continually acquiring information and knowledge from wherever I can, in any area that piques my interest.
            I see knowledge as one of the most important assets when navigating life, especially in the fast-changing world of technology.<br/><br/>

            This is probably my fifth serious attempt at pursuing cybersecurity, but this is the furthest I've come in all my attempts.
            I credit this to making the personal decision to fully commit to it. This has given me the drive to stick with it, even when facing difficult challenges.
            As a recent Computer Science graduate, I am now on my journey to becoming a fully-fledged cybersecurity professional.<br/><br/>

            Since finishing school, I have dedicated as much time as possible to sharpening my cybersecurity skills and improving my communication and interpersonal abilities.
            I recognize the importance of these skills in any workplace, and I believe you can never have too much of them in any environment.<br/><br/>

            Learning about cybersecurity has also positively impacted my personal life by teaching me accountability and time management.
            I know I have to consistently put in the hours, no matter how I might feel, to keep improving. I'm always working to better myself,
            and I believe if you're not developing yourself whenever you can, you risk falling behind.<br/><br/>
